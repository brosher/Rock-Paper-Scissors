Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project focuses on building a web page that will run a rock paper scissors game
using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The user will be playing against computer by clicking on 
rock, paper, or scissors images to go up against a computer picking randomly between the 
three choices. The program will also add up points to the desired best out of rounds. 

The main goal for this project is to become familiar with JavaScript and improve problem
solving techniques that can be applied to any programming language. Also, I will be using 
Google Chrome devtools as a debugger.
